\begin{block}{Goals for Cyder2.0}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a Waste Conditioning Facility archetype and a Simple Heat-Limited Repository archetype that can be optimized to load waste packages into the repository based on a thermal constraints. 
	\item Add both archetypes into the Predicting the Past \Cyclus simulation to simulate loading U.S. nuclear waste packages into a final waste repository. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Current Work}
	Creating the Conditioning Facility archetype
\end{block}

\begin{block}{How the Conditioning Facility archetype works}
The user can specify the commodity and material resource object that the archetype accepts and produces. Based on that, the archetype conditions the input and puts it into the form of the user-specified output.
