	\frametitle{PyRe: Cyclus (Py)ro (Re)processing Module}
	\begin{block}{Timeline:} 
	The archetype will be functional with preliminary efficiencies early \textbf{August 2018}. \\
	A more detailed PyRe will be completed for ANTPC in \textbf{September 2018}.
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Archetype Uses:} 
	PyRe will answer the following questions
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What is the affect of introducing pyroprocessing plants in the fuel cycle?
		\item How do various facility designs affect throughput and efficiency?
		\item What are the best points to monitor a pyroprocessing plant for diversion?
	\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{block}{Where is PyRe?} 
	PyRe can be found in the "pyre" branch of recycle: 	\href{https://github.com/arfc/recycle}{arfc/recycle.}
