  \frametitle{Predicting the Past: Spent Fuel Mass Validation}

\begin{block}{What is Predicting the Past? }
Predicting the Past uses published data of the 112 commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. to create a \Cyclus simulation of the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Current Work}
Comparison between spent fuel mass and isotopic compositions from the predicting the past \Cyclus output and spent nuclear fuel inventory from the U.S Department of Energy sponsored Unified Database\cite{peterson_unf-st&dards_2017} was conducted. This work has been submitted to ANS Winter 2018.
