\begin{block}{Goals for the Demand Driven Cycamore Archetype (d3ploy)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Develop an archetype that gives \Cyclus the capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to meet front-end and back-end demands of the fuel cycle. 
	\item Develop three types of prediction algorithms to achieve this capability: Non-optimizing, Deterministic Optimizing, Stochastic Optimizing. Each will improve on the previous algorithm to make the predictions more accurate. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{How it works}
User-specified inputs: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A commodity that the user wants to demand. 
	\item Growth rate of that specific commodity 
	\item The facilities in the simulation and their corresponding parameters
\end{enumerate}
Using the user-specified inputs, the archetype will deploy facilities and supporting facilities to meet the demand for the specified commodity and the supporting commodities required to produce it.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Numerical experiments to test the non-optimizing and deterministic optimizing prediction algorithms. 
		\item A Report is written for each type of prediction algorithm. The report for the non-optimizing case can be found at \cite{bae_numerical_2018}.
